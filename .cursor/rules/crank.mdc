This project uses Crank for rendering the UI. That is similar to React, but different in important ways.
Components should have a first parameter `this: Context` that is the context of the component.

Note this pattern for updating state (prefer the new way!):

```
// Before: Easy to forget refresh()
const onclick = () => {
  count++;
  this.refresh(); // Oops, might forget this!
};

// Now: Impossible to forget
const onclick = () => this.refresh(() => count++);
```

Look up documentation when you need to know something.
